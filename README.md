# Live-IRL-ATC-in-GeoFS

This adds live IRL ATC streamed by liveatc.net in GeoFS. Currently, the addon is in development and may not work.

Current features:
 - Only plays ATC for KMIA
 - If you're below 1000 ft AGL it will play KMIA ground, else it will play KMIA Approach 1 & 2
 - Only plays when you are within a certain distance of the airport (not sure what that distance is rn)

Planned features:
 - Later I'll add a few more airports to it and turn it over to the community to expand it if they want
 - Only runs when you have ADS-B traffic turned on
